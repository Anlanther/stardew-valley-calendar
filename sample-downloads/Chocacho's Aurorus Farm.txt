rocks in the Volcano, Skull Cavern, and the Mines (the mussel-covered rocks on the beach work as well)\n\nChopping down trees (I've gotten beans from the first axe-hit, the second/last axe hit, and from removing the stump afterwards)\n\nHoeing spots with worms (Confirmed to work on the Island and in town)\n\nFishing (Beans can be fished just like junk, or appear in treasure chests)\n\nVolcano Mine chests (thanks u/VeeRook) and crates\n\nProcessing geodes (thanks u/i_am_socrates) (Per u/PWK0, all geodes effectively drop beans at the same rate.)\n\nShaking mahogany trees (even on the regular farm, in winter)\n\nHarvesting crops in the farm area of the Island (not the 'Island Farm' map)\n\nI have NOT gotten Qi Beans from these actions:\n\nHarvesting crops from my farm\n\nPicking up items (dandelions, e.g.) off the ground (Foraging)\n\nHere are some tips for completing this challenge:\n\nThe only Qi Fruits you should ship are the ones harvested within 3 days of the deadline. All Qi Fruit harvested before then should be put into Seed Makers, growing your crop exponentially.\n\nYou will need a LOT of space to grow your crops. You might do this in the winter (u/RedCole111 suggests this, too), but I maximized my time by filling my farm with cheap, quick-growing crops (parsnips, radishes/wheat, bok choy) and harvesting only to make room for Qi Beans. This saved me the time of tilling, watering, and fertilizing new land every day.\n\nUse Deluxe Speed-Gro to grow Qi Fruit in 3 days instead of 4. Switching to Agriculturist as well reduces grow time further (2 days!).\n\nIt's likely that you will have to drop everything in the pursuit of Qi Beans. Don't worry about harvesting your Kegbarns or any of that, you have Qi Fruit to collect!","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":0,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"65cb8a24-30f5-40c4-87a9-32e98f1d7ab4"},"id":"8bfdc3d7-a91f-4354-8177-c4aad22b3e18","publishedAt":""},{"title":"get leeks for spring","tag":"farming","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":0,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"1dceafb7-ab1e-45f5-aea4-a2c81edef0ac"},"id":"a0412696-b925-41bd-9f31-75c1d3dcd243","publishedAt":""},{"title":"get horseradish down farm ","tag":"foraging","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"b077f755-af71-4944-adda-2dd98d4d9b35"},"id":"616abfa5-7d4e-4e18-83c7-12333fb25726","publishedAt":""},{"title":"go get two quests first","tag":"festival","description":"quest \n8am willy\n9am pierre","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"b0e36485-614e-47b2-b3b2-07a151bd523a"},"id":"39de5b59-9b05-4614-a349-ff0f7e6db8df","publishedAt":""},{"title":"buy more speed gro 9am","tag":"farming","description":"buy extra for qi beans ","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"aab71faa-2ec0-4c7f-bd05-be8087028ca3"},"id":"e6b1340f-898d-4f96-89c9-020efeb4db8f","publishedAt":""},{"title":"put speed gro on ancient seeds and qi","tag":"farming","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"13abb24c-d45d-412d-97f1-fabeb89c1aa1"},"id":"09c22e79-2447-43e7-8c6b-43aa90ebe96b","publishedAt":""},{"title":"racoon dandelion juice, pickled cauliflower","tag":"farming","description":"make","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"cab2b9c0-701d-4149-9d29-f78d3df166ed"},"id":"14707b3d-1e6c-4971-9333-f5caf98d5416","publishedAt":""},{"title":"bear carp then cut trees for qi beans","tag":"gift","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"657dc0a7-6ee6-45e1-b34e-956a9d3376af"},"id":"a7a159d8-2bb2-47fb-b858-eb837c3ea8c9","publishedAt":""},{"title":"go get leek up farm going to mountain after quest","tag":"foraging","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"6d1c4d6e-8710-4da6-9975-64bfdcc690a9"},"id":"5cd24ca2-eef6-4393-8c21-55124a57fa20","publishedAt":""},{"title":"plant qi seeds and spring and speed grow","tag":"farming","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":2,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"9c66ca76-7705-4661-b83b-36425722cfe8"},"id":"bd91685c-b52e-492f-90f4-a48748f439ff","publishedAt":""},{"title":"leek horseradish mountain","tag":"foraging","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":3,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"4f9d37b0-5be9-4d74-9e38-d66b2aad9117"},"id":"e739fae7-8fc8-4a87-92dd-004971ed1e66","publishedAt":""},{"title":"clean up farm","tag":"foraging","description":"","type":"user","gameDate":{"day":3,"isRecurring":false,"season":"spring","year":3,"id":"f83758ee-c511-468f-b4a0-ea726dff3a8d"},"id":"059e6195-de0f-4392-b5dc-8d3513e78f6a","publishedAt":""}],"systemConfig":{"includeBirthdays":true,"includeFestivals":true,"includeCrops":true}}
